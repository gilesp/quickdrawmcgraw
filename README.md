Musing on a drawing machine

Code is mostly python, intended to be run on a raspberry pi, talking to some stepper motors.

I've been exploring two options for the physical design. Originally I was looking at  ascar style arm, with a shoulder and elbow configuration but I've also been looking at a more traidtional plotter style setup, using corexy mechanics.

The current state of the design can be seen here: https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard/projects/lWJfVcbC5sg-drawing-machine
