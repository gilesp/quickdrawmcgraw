Thoughts and notes on building a corexy style crawing machine
(plotter?) using nanobeam aluminium extrusion

* General Thoughts
  Controlled using raspberyy pi zero, with a 4tronix quad stepper
  motor hat.

  Intention is to make it light enough that it could be mounted to a
  whiteboard using suckers. Initially though, will be using flat on a
  table.

** Linear Movement
   3D Printed component to hold one nanobeam and slide along the
   grooves of another.

** Motors
   Small stepper motors.
   Intended to be used in scanners? Certainly, look the same as ones
   in Canon lide scanners I've disassembled. Probably high speed but
   low torque so will need some gearing to move the mechanism around.
